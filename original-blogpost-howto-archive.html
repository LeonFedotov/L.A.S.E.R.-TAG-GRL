<b>UPDATE: !!!!! <a href='http://muonics.net/blog/index.php?postid=26'>LASER TAG 2002 IS RELEASED - Feb 2008</a> !!!!!</b><br />
<br />
The main event of the GRL Rotterdam tour - 'L.A.S.E.R TAG' - 60mw geek graffiti madness. <br />
Watch the <a href='http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=76'>video here</a> on the <a href='http://graffitiresearchlab.com/'>Graffiti Research Lab</a> website.<br />
<br />
In the spirt of GRL's and <a href='http://www.eyebeam.org'>Eyebeam's</a> open source beliefs, we are posting the code and executable <br />
for the Laser Tag application online for you to download, dissect, reuse and hopefully improve. The code is <br />
C++ and compiled in a super old school Codewarrior IDE for windows but it is oepnGL based and written <br />
using <a href='http://www.openFrameworks.cc'>openFrameworks</a> which is a cross platform library for writing creative code. So it should be very <br />
straight forward to run in Visual Studio, DevC++ or even xcode on a mac.<br />
<br />
In its simplest form the Laser Tag system is a camera and laptop setup, tracking a green laser point across <br />
the face of a building and generating graphics based on the laser's position which then get projected back <br />
onto the building with a high power projector.<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of things you need to do to get Laser Tag up and running yourself, so here follows the required <br />
equipment and setup instructions. This will assume that you using windows but it will also apply for other OSs too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>EQUIPMENT</b><br />
<br />
We used:<br />
<br />
1  PC Laptop - ASUS A8JS - Core 2 Duo 1.83 Ghz 1GB Ram Nvideo Geforce Go 7300 256MB - VGA and DVI out.<br />
1  Pansonic  PTD5600U 5000 ANSI Lumens 1024x768 DLP Projector.<br />
1  Watec 221S Security/Astrononmy Camera with manual iris zoom lens.<br />
1  Bogen magic arm and super clamp.<br />
1  Pinnacle PCTV USB capture card.<br />
1  60mW Green Laser (super illegal in a lot of places and very dangerous)<br />
     and loads and loads of AAA batteries.<br />
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/urban_data/396081705/'><br />
<img border ='0' src='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/396081705_25539b75fc.jpg?v=0'><br />
</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>SETUP</b><br />
<br />
<b>Location:</b><br />
<br />
Choose a building or wall that the laser shows up well on. If using a building make sure the lights aren't on <br />
as this will make the tracking of the laser beam harder (also it is not a good idea to point powerful lasers <br />
at a building with people in it) . <br />
<br />
Pick a spot far enough back that the projector can overshoot the building by a couple of feet on all sides. <br />
<br />
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/urban_data/396082609/'><img border ='0' src='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/115/396082609_fe4290b30c.jpg?v=0'></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Alignment and calibration:</b><br />
 <br />
If the building is vertically orientated and the projector can handle it, put the projector on its side so you are <br />
using the full image of the projection. <br />
<br />
Fix the projector in place and then fix the camera underneath the lens of the projector so that it is looking at the<br />
projection area. Allow the camera to see a little more than the projection area so that you can designate an area <br />
as a clear button.<br />
<br />
Make sure all the settings on the camera are set to manual - no auto exposure or gain control etc. Adjust the color <br />
balance of the camera so that it looks as natural as possible - make sure any lights in the shot don't look green as this<br />
will confuse the tracking sytem.  <br />
<br />
<b>Software setup:</b><br />
<br />
Set your resolution of your screen to 1024 by 768.<br />
<br />
Connect the projector to the PC and in your display control panel set the display mode to horizontal span. <br />
This should span the Desktop across the laptop screen and the projector so that you have one large screen <br />
of  2048 by 768 resolution. If you have access to openGL and 3D preferences in the control panel, set all settings<br />
to performance. <br />
<br />
Connect the camera to the usb capture card and the capture card to the PC. You can use <a href='http://download.videohelp.com/download/amcap911.zip'>Amcap</a><br />
to make sure you can capture video okay.<br />
<br />
Start the app and you should see something like the image bellow. <br />
Follow the instructions in the diagram to align the camera to the projection surface.<br />
<br />
<img src='http://muonics.net/extras/laserguide.png'><br />
<br />
Once the camera is aligned to the projector hide the white alignment lines on the projected image by pressing L.<br />
Turn down the iris of the camera to the point where the surface is as dark as possible but the laser still shows up strong.<br />
<br />
<b>Settings:</b><br />
<br />
The settings for the app are saved in an xml file so once you have made your adjustments hit the S key to save your changes.<br />
The up and down arrows on your keyboard will run through the list of settings and the left and right arrows can adjust the values.<br />
<br />
The first settings you will want to adjust is the four at the bottom - which define the color tracking of the laser.<br />
<br />
<b>Hue Point</b>              - should be the value of green that the camera sees the laser as.<br />
<b>Hue Thresh</b>             - is how wide a range from the hue point it should consider.<br />
<b>Sat Thresh</b>             - is the minimum amount of saturation.<br />
<b>Value Thresh</b>           - is the minimum brightness.<br />
<br />
Anything that is outside the range of these settings will show up as black in the Thresh Video anything that is whithin<br />
(hopefully only the laser point) should show up white.<br />
<br />
Here is an explanation of the rest of the settings:<br />
<br />
<b>Slide</b>              - slides the screen over so you can see what is being projected<br />
<b>Verticle mode</b>      - if the projector is being used on its side.<br />
<b>Use blobs</b>          - should stay on,  blob tracking ended up being more reliable than motion difference.<br />
<b>Motion diff</b>        - don't touch<br />
<b>Use camera</b>         - toggle between using the live camera and an included test video.<br />
<b>Drips mode</b>         - when on, small drips of paint will descend from the letter forms.<br />
<b>Fade out</b>           - slowely fades the image over time - alternative to clear button.<br />
<b>Slant brush</b>        - toggles chisel brush and fatcap mode<br />
<b>Clear zone</b>         - Use an area of the image as a clear zone, if the laser is detected there it clears the image.<br />
<br />
<b>Brush width</b>        - Size of brush<br />
<b>Drips freq</b>         - How many drips you want - lower is more<br />
<b>Activity thresh</b>    - This determines the time before starting a new line, the background screen should flash red whenever a new line begins.<br />
<b>Min blob size</b>      - the smaller this value the more sensitive to noise it will be but also the smoother the line motion.<br />
<b>Jump dist</b>          - the max distance to draw a line between two captured points, any distance greater means it starts a new line.<br />
<b>Line resolution</b>    - how many points to interpolated a line with, higher number means smoother line but uses more cpu.<br />
<b>Clear X</b>            - adjust x position of clear area. <br />
<b>Clear Y</b>		   - same for y<br />
<b>Clear thresh</b>       - lower means a more sensitive clear area , higher less sensitive - adjust so that only laser point clears image.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>NOTES</b><br />
<br />
Once everything is setup be very careful not to bump either projector or camera as even a move of a 1mm will be<br />
enough to mess the alignment.<br />
<br />
The settings are saved in settings.xml file - if you want to back up your settings for a location just zip the file and rename it.<br />
<br />
If you are pushed for framerate - try overclocking your graphics with hacked drivers from <a href='http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/index.php?drivers'>laptopvideo2go</a>,<br />
you will notice quite a difference!<br />
<br />
Press h to hide all gui except the projected image, this can also give you a bump in the framerate too.<br />

Also if you want to use the same IDE to recompile the apps:<br />
Get it here <a href='http://www.megaupload.com/?d=CMMGTRMZ'>IDE</a> link now live. <br />
Install all 3 updates and make sure you click the yes button on the last update to recompile the libs<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE:</b><br />
I have compiled an app with S-Video support for those that asked. <br />
Put the new exe in the same folder as the old one (app/LASER_TEST_013_DAY1/bin) <br />
The app will try and capture via s-video.<br />

	    Absolutely awesome. That's why the hacker ethic says "you can create art and beauty with a computer". Thanks for releasing the software, maybe we're going to have some fun with it. Although we might need to find a replacement for the Laser...<br />
<br />
By the way, if you don't want to get into trouble with Flickr, you should link the photos back to their corresponding photo pages.

	    Hey there,<br />
I am a photo-journalist from Portugal, but i´ve studied in the city of Leeuwarden- Friesland- for 6 months, and one night I saw people doing these laser tags and I was simply amazed. I myself have a background of graffiti sketches and tags,so although I have followed photography I am still quite interested in the visual arts,if I am naming it wrong I apologize.I have a Clasus balance nw-128 laptop, 2.0 ghz, 128 mb graphics card, ando also a Canon MVX3i Mini DV Camcorder. I would love to get into this, but I ask if there is any equipment that you could point out to me, but something not as expensive and as professional,but that can still do a nice job? I ask not because I don´t take it seriously, but to begin I think something more accessible would suffice. <br />
I enjoyed reading and seeing the video about this iniciative.<br />
Best of luck, the world needs to see diferently!<br />
<br />
Cheers!!!

	    No - from what I hear those projectors are hard to come by - and expensive! Also if they are that bright it might make it harder to didtinguish the laser point. If you have a spare one though I am up for giving it a try!

	    Hello, I m working in a french event company. I m very fond of your "laser tag" technic. I d like to use it on a coming event in september in Paris.<br />
<br />
Do you realize / produce / commercialize yourself this work? If yes, do you have a formal presentation and a phone number / contact to send us? If not, is this work "free of use" by other companies? I mean can we produce it ourself?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your quick answer ! And well done for your work.<br />
<br />
Mathieu

	    this is the greatest show of digital art i have ever seen. -- did you guys specifically  choose the 5600u because of high lumen output ?

	    Actually we got that one because it was liquid cooled and could be put in almost any position without damaging the bulb. Also because it was DLP you get a pretty good contrast ratio. We got two of them because we though we would need to double them up or something but we only ended needing one it was so bight.

	    Houses are not very cheap and not everybody can buy it. But, personal loans are created to support people in such kind of cases.

	    Yeah - you have to be super careful. That is  why it is better if you do it against an empty building or large wall or something. The laser snuff clip at the end was very irresponsible :)

	    Nice, the idiotic, but funny part of aiming that laser at a person reminded me of a very fun weapon in a great game: HALO! The glow looked exactly like the plasma pistol fully charged....... Anyways, I'm gonna try to set up a smaller scale of it, and stick it on the Remote Controlled Tank I've got, In addition to the airsoft cannon and the new GPS system so that the UAV can calibrate it! Once it's done I'll send you guys a video of the entire armada in action! Plus the laser is pretty powerful, but is small compared to the 120mW laser on the tank.... prototype for a anti-munitions defense system....

	    Hi there, great project!  It makes me think of the project in Germany where they put up a huge amount of light bulbs in each window of a huge building and those lights were then controlled by people who would send SMS through a website.  Can someone find the link to that site?<br />
<br />
Also, can someone post where we can purchat the 60 mW laser?  I've seen one here but it looks HUGE, is that what's needed?<br />

	    The project in germany was called Blinkin Lights I think. That is a seriously large laser - what you want is the ones in the consumer electronics sections http://electronics.listings.ebay.ca/Gadgets-Other-Electronics_Laser-Pointers_W0QQfromZR4QQsacatZ94881QQsocmdZListingItemList<br />
We also bought a lot from http://www.wickedlasers.com<br />
<br />
If you are doing it on a smaller scale you won't need 60mW - you could even get away with 8mW. Obviously it is best to use the laser lowest power possible.<br />

	    Thanks for posting the source code! I am making this my summer project. I am going to try to hook this up to a synthesizer, a sound system and make laser music with it. I will post my progress. Thanks again!!

	    Well if you can get hold of a pc, a projector and a camera of some sort - you might be able to get it to work. The important thing with the camera is to be able to turn off all the auto 'features'

	    The important thing with the camera is to be able to turn off all the auto 'features' - So auto exposure, auto iris, backlight compensation, white balance etc.<br />
<br />
Then in theory any camera will work.

	    Alright this is great. And I have a projector and a webcam. So in theroy this should would. But when I plug in my firewire webcam the captured input has all verticles lines but you can kinda make out colors. Is this cause im using a firewire? (note this is really short distance like 4 feet)<br />
<br />
And if I wanted to change the lasers color to red for instance i should just change the hue point correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

	    Hmm - some firewire cameras work. DV ones don't unfortuantely. Usually if Amcap can see it, then you can use it. <br />
<br />
With the red laser thing - that is correct, just change the hue point. The green lasers tend to appear brighter.

	    Thank you for the reply. Well the interesting thing is Amcap does see it but like you said DV cameras won't work and thats what I'm using so I will either find a webcam or recompile the program to accept 720x720(?) and hope the computer can handle it.<br />

	    Hey I am almost certain the computer won't be able to handle it as pixels wise that is 4.5 times the amount of data to process. When you are doing many operations on the image even doubling the amoutn of data can be crippling.<br />
I would suggest going analog out of the DV cam and use a cheap capture card.

	    Any tips on using a firewire video input, like from a DV cam?  I've tried, but the setup program seems to lock up at: "Capture device doesn't support 320 by 240.  Reverting to 720 by 480."<br />
<br />

	    yeah DV cams are tricky. Unfortunately the code is set to use 320 by 240 (720 is just too slow for the computer vision stuff). To fix this you can use $50 usb capture card (pinnacle pctv usb or wintv usb ) with your DV cameras analog out - or recompile the code to resize the DV cam  to a 320 by 240 image (much harder).

	    Thanks for the quick reply.  Too bad about the lack of DV cam support, they're so ubiquitous that it would make the project just that much simpler for folks on a budget.  Anyway, this is a fantastic idea, very creative.  Thanks again for sharing the concept, the code, and your knowledge.  Keep up the good work!

	    That'd be a fantastic idea, but unfortunately the wiimote tracks motion by picking up a pair of infrared emissions from the sensor bar, so you'd need to build some sort of high-powered infrared emitter pair and put them on top of the building!

	    What you can do, is get the IR filter off the Wiimote and use it in place of the camera. It supports 1024x768 motion tracking with 100Hz. Not sure about the light sensitivity though.

	    Prob need to be minimum 3.2Ghz P4 - there is quite a lot of heavy number crunching going on. Also the nvidia graphics cards can do horizontal span which is important.

	    just for info, if you guys want to test the software : i have no laser and no expensive camera, but i got the software to work just by moving the (green)power led of my laser mouse (logitech mx610) in front of my cheap webcam. works great

I'm planning on building this project myself. I've already got the software to work, and couple other things. I would like to get some more info about the video input. Can someone please contact me?<br />

	    One thing to<br />
consider, which might allow for using a lower power laser. If you were to put a suitable green optical filter in front of the<br />
camera, and then only project graphics in a non-green color, then the camera can<br />
only see the laser<br />
spot through the filter, so you may be able to crank up the gain of the camera, and use a lower powered laser.<br />
This might also allow one to use a<br />
red laser pointer at<br />
much lower cost if you were to use a red filter (any photo/video store), and then project in<br />
high visibility green. Keep in mind that green is at the<br />
top of the eye response curve, so<br />
you could also use<br />
less of a projector,<br />
depending on the <br />
projection surface.<br />
Meantime, great project, am anxious<br />
to try it myself!<br />
Thanks!<br />

	    Yeah that makes sense - it is definatley better to filter out as much as possible befire you get to the image processing stage. One of the problems though is that the laser is so bright the camera does not see much of the green - of course dropping the power will help of course.

	    Nice!  I'll have to try it.  Have you tried putting a 532nm dichroic filter (or reflector) on the camera??  That would cut out most of the ambient light, allowing only the laser.  More contrast, less laser power needed...<br />

	    No we didn't - that sounds nice though? Is that just for the green spectrum or is it more just a very high threshold filter?

	    Sorry about the formatting.. You can get specific 532 narrowband filters, however they tend to have low transmission specs, which cut the amount of light to the camera. You could use a much wider band filter such as a dichroic type that is used in lighting instruments. These have the benefit that you can angle tune them for color selection, and quite large ones aren't that expensive. Even good quality plastic<br />
type lighting gel may work if the clarity is good.<br />
I've included my URL for some of my laser stuff that folks here may be interested in.<br />
Thanks again!<br />

	    Thanks - I think for the next outing we will experiment with that - it is always useful to be able to do that stuff before you even take it into the computer, especially if you can't turn off the lights in the building (we had people running around every night to make sure the lights were off). <br />
<br />
I looked at your website, I am super impressed. We have been talking about making a laser projector for a while now but that thing is amazing! I can't believe how good the colors look.  Do you have any videos of it in action?

	    Sweet.  I borrowed projector out of the office, picked up a $3   red laser pointer at the store and snagged my kids eye toy. Within an hour they were drawing on the side of the house. This is going to be their science project this year.  Thanks for the code.

	    Ahh ha - I was waiting for this question to pop up. The Drips were programmed very quickly and so I didn't have time to add a setting to change their direction etc. If you can find the drips function in the source code it is a simple matter of changing x++ to x-- and then making sure they don't go off the edge of the image (massive memory error will occur) - otherwise just turn the drips off in the settings, it is still impressive without. :)

The way to fix the drips is play with the corners of the white rectangle in the projection window. This is much easier then messing wit the code (also safer).

	    I don't have any live video of the full color laser video projector. I do have some video of a single color (argon only) LV projector that I built to the project on a water curtain at a theme park in Italy, Gardaland. I also have some live video tape of it in the shop showing it's interior while <br />
working. Also, it may be entirely possible to do the<br />
"writing" using a IR<br />
laser diode type pointer, and then using a video camera in night vision mode which puts an IR filter in front of the chip. All consumer video camera's are very sensitive to the near IR and if you were to hack certain green laser pointers, you can remove their internal fundamental IR pump diode filters and get an IR laser pointer, at<br />
very high (and illegal) power. It would be much better to get an 800 and some nm laser diode and build it into a <br />
pointer, then you could project ANY color you wanted as the scanner camera would just be looking for IR instead of visible.<br />
It might not be as cool looking as a nice high power green pointer though!<br />

	    Yeah I was wondering about IR lasers. I use IR filters on my cameras for a lot of stuff that I do - just so you don't have to worry about what you are projecting. I didn't realise that making an IR laser was so straightforward. But it makes sense - if the laser can produce heat that it should transmit in the infrared spectrum too right? The only downside I can see to using this method would be any infra-red light coming from the building - but maybe the level would be pretty low in comparison to the laser so you could just close the iris of the camera down or something. One of the other reasons we just projected white is to make the image as bright as possible. But if we could get a brighter projector it would be fun to experiement with color 'tagging too'

	    This should be an easy fix if you can recompile the app. <br />
<br />
make sure before VI-&gt;setup(0); you have a line VI-&gt;setPhyCon(0, VI_S_VIDEO); (in testapp.cpp)<br />
<br />
The app is set to use Composite by default. If you don't feel like rebuilding the app plug the camera into the composite (yellow rca port) port of the capture card.

	    I've had a project that I've been working on in various forms since about 1986. I fear that if I ever took it to Burning Man, it could cause severe mental distress/religious conversion amongst the crowds. Imagine a 20-30ft plasma ball with live video wrapped around the diameter, yet it can be packed up into a few roadcases, or "flown" with only needed about 500lbs of lift. I may yet have funding for it before I "burn up", but I'm not getting any younger (but still somewhat dangerous...)<br />

	    The code it self is built with openFrameworks http://openframeworks.cc which is cross platform. To make this run on a mac you would need to replace the videoinput capture system with quicktime code (part of openFrameworks) and find the OS X compatible version of Intel's IPP. It is very possible to get this tunning on a mac but it would be a fair amount of work.

	    Love this project. It'd be interesting to know how long this has been in development. I also worked on a project in my final year at uni with a similar concept although mine was more product design centred and works in a different way. Shares the overall concept though of the possibility of creating huge graffiti artwork on buildings. Check it out on my coroflot link.  http://www.coroflot.com/nick_hunter  also check the video out at: http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=753660817452444876&amp;hl=en-GB

	    I'll gladly take a stab at compiling this for OS X. I'd like to get it running on my Powerbook. (Although it's been a while since I've done anything in C++.) Any idea when Openframeworks will have a public release?

	    Cool man look forward to seeing it. <br />
<br />
Things that will you'll run across:<br />
The video capture library is windows only but openFrameworks can capture using quicktime on a mac. Check out the ofQtVideoGrabber class. Also the XML parser might not be cross platform and that is used pretty heavily to read and save the settings. Also you'll need Intel's IPP for OS X.  If you want an Xcode project set up for openFrameworks send me an email and I'll send you a link.<br />
<br />
Oh and quite a big thing is that there is no IPP for G4 based laptops only the newer intel macbook (and macbook pro).

	    Sorry, please ignore my previous post regarding the mac questions.  I'll follow this link here instead.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the other poster for taking a stab at this.  I for one greatly appreciate this and to Theo for developing this wonder tool!  This truely has been one of the most exciting technological art pieces I have seen in a while (and I've been to Burninman 5 times....and this is so Burningman!).<br />
<br />
If there is any support, help, whathave you regarding getting this Mac version going let me know.  I've not programmed in a while, but I know my way around a computer and am a good problem solver.  Even if you need me to find out info (IE like finding these modules in the library).

	    Awesome project!  Thanks especially for sharing the code and exe. :)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I had some issues getting the system running properly...<br />
<br />
I couldn't get any hue point (or threshold values) to work for my red laser pointers (in a dark room with a white wall). :(  It looked like it almost worked but not quite (as if something was wrong with the hue point algorithm).  Have you tried the system with a red laser?<br />
<br />
The default output was tilted 90 degrees and when I used "vertical" mode to fix this eveything was upside down- since there was no "flip" mode I couldn't fix this without turning my camera or prjector upside down. :(<br />
<br />
Any fixes for the above?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

	    <br><br>
	    In regards to the Laser point - firstly does the camera see it as red or is it so bright that it appears white to the camera? If so adjust your camera settings so that the image is dark enough for the laser to appear red. A good way to test the color thresholding is to take some image that has a wide variety of colors and put it on the wall - then with the saturation at brightness at 0.2 and hue width at 0.3 then go up and down with the hue point and see when the red parts in the images start showing up. <br />
<br />
It is also useful to do all the tracking stuff before you even switch the projector on. Another problem it could be is that with the projector so close to the wall the projection is too bright and is interfering with the tracking.<br />
<br />
In regards to the image being upside down, that is no problem. Just switch the corners of the yellow quad around - this will flip the image vertically and fix your problem (its mentioned in step 2 of the guide above).

	    Sure why not! Give it a go :)<br />
Make sure you adjust your webcam settings (you can do this with amcap) so that all the auto stuff is turned off and the image is bright enough to see the laser pointer.

	    I have almost everything needed (just need a different camera or a way in with the svideo port. My question is this: Right now when I run the program after changing the monitor properties to "extend my windows desktop" to the other monitor output (my BENQ projector) the other side does not display the projected image. I dont know what else to try.<br />
<br />
Also has anyone found a cheap webcam or something similar that has worked for them? My DV camera comes in fine on AMCap but is scrambled on the software. I am probably going to try a point and shoot camera next to see if that gets me anywhere.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

	    I compiled an S-video app - see the update at the end of the post.<br />
<br />
If that still doesn't work a logitech quickcam will do the job. <br />
<br />
First open it up in Amcap and make sure you change all the quickcam settings to manual - auto exposure white balance etc. Make it so it looks good in amcap and those settings will be saved when you run it in the laser app.<br />
<br />
In regards to the projector you need to specifically set Horizontal Span in the Nvida graphics card settings. If you don't have an Nvidia graphics card then I don't think it will work.

	    Just wanted to mention in regards to possibly using IR instead of visible for the tracking.. Quite a few of the lower cost green lasers pointers that have come out of Asia are lacking a IR blocking filter on the output. This in some cases allows many milliwatts of both the 808nm pump diode IR, as well as the 1064 fundamental IR from the YAG section of the laser. The 808nm would be easily picked up by any video camera that can run in nightvision mode. The idea would be to put a visible blocking filter in front of your green pointer, and see if you can still pick up the tracking spot on a camera set for nightvision. Due to the high power of the IR pump diode, I would guess that there is enough leakage from even "good" green pointers to give IR tracking..<br />

	    Yeah I just tried it - I put a Kodak 87C filter in front of the green laser and my IR camera saw just as much light with the filter as without. That is pretty handy to know I guess they (the chinese) forgot the filter after all :)

	    well unless it can do nvidia style horizontal span than yes - google around for hacked drivers etc - on my laptop I had to install modfiied drivers to do horz span.

	    Hey Theo,<br />
<br />
More on the MacBook Pro - Boot Camp front.  So I got Laser Tag up and running on my MacBook Pro.  After figuring out how to configure the system to get dual montior set up going.  I then open up Laser Tag and the Windows Desktop still stay up on the 2nd Monitor (projector).  <br />
<br />
My video card is a ATI Radeon X1600<br />
<br />
Can you point your laser to a point where i might find assistance in getting them to work with Laser Tag?  <br />
<br />
God I'm so close to having this running on my Mac!!! I can't wait!!!<br />
<br />
I've been drooling for too long!<br />

	    They Theo thanks for incredibly fast responses to everyone's queries, thats really great.  I was wondering if this software/projector could be manipulated into creating motion that reacts to other motion.  Such as the classic game "PONG," one object in motion strikes the ball which reacts to a different direction.  Would it be possible to create this kind of visual effect with this technology? Certainly not saying it isn't already 100 % amazing, but wondering what it's limits were.<br />
Thank you :)

	    Great idea and great prog. But I cannot span the screen to the projector so that it becomes one 2048x768 screen. I guess that many people with ATI videocards will have same problem - and the projector will stay black. Can you redo the program that it actually uses the second monitor directly (without need of horizontal span)?

	    Hmm From what I read you can download ATI's HydraVision software which lets you span your desktop across both monitors. Otherwise I think there is also a windows display option too I think. <br />
<br />
the other easier option is to set the projector as your primary display and then set the 'slide' value in the laser tag software to 1.

	    hi, first of all i want to thank you for releasing the source code, i have one question regarding the color of the the projected image, using a 2100 lumens projector i can only see a white line and in the video and in the photos the color of the projected image is blue/green, my know how of c++ is none but if you can point me where i can change the color... (maybe glColor3f(1,1,1);... dunno)...<br />
<br />

	    No actually it is white - it just appears blue green in the video/photos. It has to be white because we are doing hue sat val tracking and this way the projection does not interfer with the laser.

	    Thought you all might be interested in a related bit of coolness. I ran across an artist in the SoCal desert doing light projection art at random places. Really gets your attention at midnight. <br />

<br />
She's using a program called Kaleidica and some other visual tools. see <br />

Once I get hold of a projector I'm off to graffiti art onto some old buildings. <br />

	    Theo!!!  awesome, super super awesome.  absolutely correct, no password.   i am one step away from recreating this badass art.  camera settings are perfect, only the laser beam shows up in the thresh window, i can \\\'paint\\\' in the warped video area, i can clear the buffers by hitting the beam in the red box.<br />
<br />
i have an intel graphics driver on my laptop, which has a setting to explicitly allow \\\'horizontal spanning\\\'.  both graphics windows are 1024x768.<br />
<br />
i cannot, however, get the projector to output the paint.  it will output my mouse cursor, if i slide my cursor too far to the right (or the left, if i make the projector my primary display)<br />
<br />
might you have a suggestion towards trouble-shooting the output?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

	    WOOOHOOOOO!  got it man!<br />
<br />
from an earlier post, set the laptop to be secondary and the projector as primary, and then use the slide function from the software!!! AWESOME!!!!<br />
we are gonna paint TONIGHT!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
would still like to figure out how to get the output to the projector without using it as primary monitor, so we can change paramters live while painting.<br />
<br />
do you have any insight into that?<br />

	    Thanks for the software. After some problems with ATI grafics card and exteded desktop in my notebook i´ll use slide function of your software and flip the image on projector side. Now its working and i´m happy. Using a red filter in front of the projektor will draw the graffity in red. This will also increase the trakking reliability of my green laser point.

	    Hello, <br />
<br />
I m working in a french event company. I m very fond of your \\\"laser tag\\\" technic. I d like to use it on a coming event in september in Paris.<br />
<br />
Do you realize / produce / commercialize yourself this work? If yes, do you have a formal presentation and a phone number / contact to send us? <br />
If not, is this work \\\"free of use\\\" by other companies? I mean can we produce it ourself?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your quick answer ! And well done for your work.<br />
<br />
Mathieu

	    Excellent program!  I have one problem with it though.  I am seeing only the 'config' part of the program on my first monitor.  My projector shows nothing but my desktop background.  How would I go about fixing this?<br />

	    In display options make sure you set it to Horizontal Span mode. <br />
If there isn't the option, download hacked drivers from laptopvideo2go.com this enables horizontal span in your nvidia settings.

	    An idea for you.. Assign some keys on the keyboard to change color, then you could use the keyboard as a palette to "dip" your pencil (laser) and then paint with the chosen color. Take it one step further and use some sort of custom keyboard with colored buttons or something.

	    Do you have a video signal coming in? Usually this happens when the capture card is connected but the camera is not or something like that. What is your setup.

	    Actually, I been getting some crazy stuff happening with that too. I use AmCam or whatever that program is called to see if my camera is working and to begin with it will work. And then I try to run that program and it gets to that point. I open AmCam again and nothing is being shown. I am using a Sony DVCam but running out of the AV output into a USB capture device.

	    Strange, When using AMCap I get no video coming through but when I use the cheap program that came with my USB capture device it seems to work. Could it be my USB capture device that isn't letting it work?

	    Thanks for your help but not to worry. I got it going. I found out it was jsut my lame USB Capture device. I bought it cheap hoping it would work. But I went out and got a Pinnacle PCTV one and it worked first time! Cheers anyway!! <br />
Its such a sweet program... Has anybody compiled it to work on Mac yet?

	    Hiya! This app is amazing!<br />
<br />
Can I use your images and videos to make a french how-to?<br />
<br />
I tried as soon as you released your app, and then buyed a 50mW  green laser (because red laser isn't powerful enough).<br />
<br />
It always impresses me when I start up everything and plays with it!<br />
<br />
I tried both nvidia and ati videocards, but I still have to rotate the projector 90° left to have the drips in the good direction. I use some color lenses to change color but it would be great to have a color option in your app, because  the lens destroys the projected image..<br />
<br />
Thank you releasing us your app!

	    Sure - sounds good! The drips you should be able to get working just be adjusting the corners of the two quads I think. Do you have any pics of your setup? I would love to see.

But for now there is only my testing setup.<br />

I will go a night in my school to make a huge P-Bombing (there is a perfect batiment without any window and perfectly white).<br />

I will take videos/pictures !<br />

	    Nice work guys, really interesting stuff. I live in Clearwater, FL. and there is a building in the downtown area that has writing on the side(looks like what you guys did) mostly it\'s just a weird symbol(it\'s owned by scientologists), which made me think it was just a projector or something but the other night it said \"Happy Birthday\" and it looked like handwriting so I think they might be using this method. I\'ll try and get some pics of it soon.

	    Hey Theo - so much fun.  My buddy and I have been inspired by you guys to give it a shot here in VT.  We're actually cooking it up all from scratch - thus far we have our green pointer (one of those Thinkgeek jobbies) being tracked through a Logitech Quickcam (v4l) - pain that it uses YUV (we're converting to RGB successfully) - and are tracking properly (and fast!)...  between us, we should have most of the glut pieces done tonight and maybe even some calibration.  I'll let you know how it goes for the sake of an anecdote.  Thanks for the inspiration and a super fun project.  Nothing quite like getting your computer follow a laser dot (it's almost a little creepy :)<br />
<br />
Peace!<br />

Mike

	    Wow, that is awesome! I am super curious to see the results. Can you post an update when you get it working, it is always nice to see how other people solve the same problems.<br />
What are you using for videocapture? You might be interested in my videoInput library (although it sounds like you have it figured out) http://muonics.net/school/spring05/videoInput/<br />

	    Hey - I really want to try this but I'm having problems. I'm using a webcam and this is the output I get from the app:<br />
<br />
Couldn't find preview pin using SmartTee <br />
Checking crossbar<br />
You are a webcam...<br />
crossbar? 1<br />
Default Format is set to 320 by 240<br />
Trying different capture size 320 by 240<br />
Media Type is RGB24 converted to RGB_24<br />
Could not connect pins - RenderStream()<br />
<br />
Then the app opens but I have no vid input and it just runs the demo. Any ideas?

	    Is the webcam on? the program should start the webcam. then you arrow key down to \\\\\\\"use camera\\\\\\\" and make it a 1 instead of a 0. this will replace the demo with the  live camera feed.

	    First off this is brilliant. I don\\\'t know how much money it will cost to recreate it but I sure want to try it, even if its just on my house!<br />
Going a few posts back up to the idea of pong or something... Is it possible that you can have two cameras set to two different laser colours [red and green +more] and then use one colour for each paddle? or for multi colour paintings. That would be awsome. Buliding size photoshop springs to mind.<br />
Keep up the wgreat work

	    Hey, I couldn\\\'t help but notice on GRL\\\'s main site that there was a new video (Free Avone) in which there are some pretty cool effects (affects?) used on the projection. Do you know where I could get this new update?

	    Just wondering if a Lumens 1400 projector would be suitable for this to work outdoors. And also what you think the range would be on this. Thinking of purchasing one as the 5000 is a little expensive the 1400 is a lot cheaper...

	    Hard to say!<br />
I would see if you can test it out - most liekly you could do something if you were maybe 20m away but more would be pretty dim. <br />
Try a 3000 if you can!

	    This is a great project!<br />
But I can\'t get the software working, I\'ve already tried it on two different Pcs and with several web-cams.<br />
On the first Pc,  I start the exe, it does see the camera, but then it says \"You can now grab my frame\" and it crashes.<br />
On the second pc, it arrives always at the same point but before crashing, it says something like \"error loading movie\" and then crashes...<br />
<br />
I tried also the demo included with the video input library, and there i can see the images of the camera well.<br />
I can\'t understand what is wrong, so please help me!<br />
<br />
I need the program working before May 5th, since we were organising a graffiti party ;)<br />

	    Hmm did you make sure that all the files that were downloaded on the PC were present? Oh you might also need to install quicktime player too (free from apple). The camera issues is a strange one - can you send me the output of the console so I can debug it?

	    Hmm no idea. Do you have a camera plugged it? Download AmCap and see if your camera shows up in there. IF it does it should work with the Laser Tag app. you might also need to download quicktime for pc from apple.

	    Theo, first of all this things is amazing. I was wondering if u could make this thing clear for me because i dont really understand it :S. You connect a cam with laptop and projector. Then u install the software on the laptop. When this is done, do u create the image first on the laptop or do u create it on the building and it gets captured by the laptop???? How long will the image stay on the building. As long as it has power  or what??? Can u try it out with a simple projector on a wall just to make sure it works or does it have to be one of these big ones????<br />
Thanks...

	    hello  thanx for his beautiful toolz !!!!  what do you think about LONG THROW LENS adapter on a videoprojector 1500 lumens ? do you think i could make something similar with your 4000 lumens because a 4000 lumens is to expensive for most of us ... if someone  have an idea like a fresnel lens to improve a 1500 lumens projector tell me !<br />

	    Hmm 1500 is 1500. Don't think it will make much difference. the important thing is brightness not range really. Try it with 1500 but get the brightest one you can afford.

	    Just wondering, if I already have a laptop that can run it(Its an Alienware, it better be able to handle it), and a camera that I think should be able to capture it(It cost nearly 2000$ U.S, and can capture in HD) what projector would you reccomend to put on a wall around 20x20?

	    Wow just waht i have always wanted. I have just built the system it works a treet whish i new coding so i could play with the src. My kids enjoyed standing infront of the wall it was projected on and using a green tourch could draw on the walls. This capture software is cool i wish to use it in some future projects, possibly a virtual dancemat and people tracking/projecting. I shall keep you informed.<br />
respect to all who risked there eyesite sorting this out. P.s FREE AVONE

	    You prob want to keep the saturation and value the same as how the app currently is and then just adjust the hue variable till the laser is isolated.  If the laser is showing up white - bring down the brightness in the camera settings. Also make sure auto whitebalance is off and set the whitebalence manually to provide a true a balance as possible.

	    Theo,<br />
<br />
Hey, Ive gotten everything all up and running but i am running into a few problems...<br />
<br />
HP DV9000<br />
60mW laser<br />
Panasonic DVX100a<br />
proxima c445 projector<br />
PCTV USB2 ( using analog )<br />
<br />
<br />
Were only getting 28-30FPS MAX on a GeForce 7600 with a laptopvideo2go hack. We have our 3d settings set to full performance.. Any idea why or solution?<br />
<br />
Also, while tracking  and setting everthing up the system tracks the laser perfectly fine, looks amazing in the preview GUI window, but when we slide all hell breaks loose. We are seeming to get random jumps in the tracking ( cuts out ) and random lines showing up for no reason what so ever. Although when switched back to GUI everything works flawlessly. Problems only happen with the  slide.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Also what distance was the rotterdam sequence projected from, seems like getting such a big canvas like that took a few hundred feet to set back from.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

	    the laser tag setup, can't work with a duplicate screen, it need extended your laptop screen because the video signal that go out for the projector interprets that the image of the projector is an extension of the program. I don't know if I explain good, sorry for my english. <br />

Dell M1210 laptop (GeForce Go 7400, hacked drivers)<br />
HP3130 projector<br />
60Mw Green Laser<br />
Microsoft Webcam<br />

everything seems to be okay - I can setup the system, change the screen settings, display the box, etc... however I can\'t capture/display any images. I\'m wondering if it has to do with the webcam rather than something beefier??? <br />

please help!

	    Most likely it is the camera. You need the camera image to be as dark as possible  (almost black) but still see the laser as a bright point. You should be able to adjust the camera settings. Setting auto color balance and auto exposure off is a big help. Make sure all the settings are set to manual and that the shutter speed is fast enough so that nothing but the laser shows up. That should work. If you need to adjust the camera properties download my videoInput library and run the CW demo app <a href='http://muonics.net/school/spring05/videoInput/'>videoInput</a>. Hit the 's' key twice to bring up the settings of the camera.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps - theo

<br />
We got the FPS up now by using a mac running bootcamp will all settings set to high performance. Were now getting 50-70 FPS which is killer!<br />
<br />
That has somewhat solved the problem of the jumping, but now our problem is tracking. When testing on both a 20ft distance and 100+ ft difference we cant get the laser to track and write in sync with the projection. I mean when we right an I on the wall with the laser the projection will write the I 2ft-4ft ABOVE where the laser was writing. We have the camera under the projector just still cant figure out whats going on any idea? we have the lens shift up all of the way, could that be the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

	    Hey John,<br />
<br />
Glad to hear that you got it running 50-70fps is a good rate. The alignment is totally normal. What you need to do is hit L so that the projector is projecting the white border lines. You then want to align the yellow lines of the camera box to those white lines, so the corners match. If you have to do slide mode just have a friend shine the laser pointer where each corner is - so the camera can see the point and then match the yellow corner to each point. Once all 4 points are lined up save the settings and you should be good to go. I think all this info is in the instruction graphic above.  Hope it works - theo.

	    Hey John,<br />
<br />
Can you give us further details on your Boot Camp install?<br />
<br />
I've just installed BootCamp and windows XP.<br />
<br />
It took me a while to get the 2nd display up, but now I'm trying to get it to work with the built in eyesight on my MacBook Pro but the app quits out before I can see what happens (what the error is).<br />
<br />
Would getting the Pinnacle PCTV card help?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

	    I had a great time with your YouTube posting. Thanks for posting such great renegade art! Here is where I saw it:<br />
<br />
http://www.groonk.net/blog/mt-archives/cat_technology.php<br />
<br />
Is there any danger if someone in the building looks out while the laser is flashing by?<br />
<br />
With friends, I toyed with lasers a long time ago, and would like to share a technique I hope you enjoy. <br />
<br />
We took two pieces of clear, thin glass (microscope slides), put a little clear glue in between, and shined the laser through the 'sandwich', squished it around a bit. It creates amazing displays of light. <br />
<br />
I'd be curious what a couple of nesting lenses would do, and colored glass, cut crystal and a prism would do. <br />
<br />
Have fun playing with your lasers! I look forward to seeing your next YouTube Show!!

	    Actually there is. What we have been told is that if you get it in your eye it will make you blind so quick that you won't have time to react. I don't know if this is true for long distances but I wouldn't want to find out :)

	    ATI cards don't do horizontal span I think. Though someone told me that they got it working with a different ATI setting. Without horizontal span you have to use the 'Slide' option in the menu of the laser tag app. This makes setting up harder as you have to go back and forth as you align the camera and projector. But I have done it several times. It is not fun but it still works :)

	    Theo, this project is absolutely awesome.<br />
<br />
When i try to run the aplication everything seems to be okay until i turn on the camera (sony DCR-HC40) and presents an error message: filter grabbing error loop infinitely in the CMD screen...and when i stoped the aplication reboot my pc.  <br />
<br />
In the sw Amcap camera seems ok (320 x 240)<br />
<br />
Could you help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
From Theo: Hey it must be a compatibility issue with my video capture library.  We are going to make a crossplatform laser tag with openframeworks very soon. So I will try and include the fix in that version. Thanks for being patient!<br />

	    Theo, wicked piece of open source there mate, cheers. Me and a couple of lads have got it working at our uni, and it looks great on the stereoscopic projector, massive!<br />
<br />
But we really want to get it mobile, i\'m running on a MacBook Pro and i\'ve been trying to figure out how to recompile the software in xCode, but i\'ve been having no luck getting it to do its thing, not much of a programmer i\'m afraid. Any help would be greatly appreciated, many large buildings out there a beggin for this new era of bombing!<br />
<br />
Ali<br />
<br />
Reply from theo to lazy to use form: Hey Ali, Thanks for the feedback. The code is actually quite a mess at the moment as it was written super fast. Porting it to xcode would be a pain as it is, but I think I will rewrite it for os x and pc really soon, because we will release it as a demo app in openFrameworks. Do you have any pictures off it running on the stereoscopic projector? I would love to see!  Oh also you can run it on your mac book if you boot it into windows xp. It should work.<br />
<br />

	    Now I see you need a 60mw Laser pen, if you watch this video you can save some cash by getting a cheap 5mw one and "fix" it up. This will save you some green enabling one to get a better projector. <br />

	    Hi,<br />
<br />
this is absolutely excellent stuff! Thanks so much for releasing this software freely to play around with. I wanted to test it with a camera connected to a laptop via a <i>pinnacle 510 USB<i> but I can't get the software to find the incoming video, neither does <i>AmCap<i>. However, the image displays fine in XP's <i>MovieMaker<i>. The pinnacle box has s-video, composite and dv entries, tried all of them to no avail. Tried two different cam's with it as well, a JVC <i>HD100<i> and a <i>GY-DV5001<i>. Has anyone ever successfully used the <i>pinnacle 510 usb<i> with the soft? Any ideas how to resolve the problem? I'm not much of a programmer at all, but if there's something simple to try out i'd be willing to give it a shot... any help's greatly appreciated. would definitely LOVE to try this setup out asap.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />
wolf<br />

Hey Wolf,<br />
<br />
I don't know what to suggest - if you can't see it in Amcap - that is pretty strange. I would suggest maybe seeing if they have newer drivers online. And making sure you install all the driver options. It might be not be showing as a capture device but some custom media device instead. I usually use the cheaper version of this and we had no problems with it. So you know, the software is designed to capture via the RCA port - so best to try that one when testing it out.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help - theo

	    First off, fantastic project, looks amazing..:-)<br />
<br />
second, is there a way (and would you mind) if we were to contact you directly for some advice? we are a group of activists / writers who are currently looking at setting up something similar to work with in the UK, and possibly across Europe over the summer / autumn, themed content. We have some of the equipment, and a budget to cover the rest, but need a bit of advice, as we are keen to get it right from the off.<br />
<br />
We are particularly keen to explore this (and other 'clean' forms of writing and expression) as we have had a number of arrests over the past couple of months, with some of our group waiting on court appearances, heavy fines and possible custodial sentences.  We wouldn't take up much of your time - look forward to your reply!<br />

	    Thanks a lot bad boy! I set it up in my basement, and it is the wildest toy I have ever played. I was wondering that if I set it up during a local art festical, who all exactly should I give credit for??? GRL? Agent Watson? Both? Or more? People are going to be asking about it, I would like to make signs, so people know that someone else way smarter than me designed this thing. Thanks again!!! <br />

Hey nice video on your site!! I am always happy to see other people who get it working. For credit you can just say Graffiti Research Lab. Please send us a link to any pics and videos you get of it at the festival, we love that stuff!<br />

	    On the topic of IR laser pointers being used, you can get surplus military targeting lasers for pretty decent prices, in the class 3b range (5-500wm).  I have an AIM-1/MLR that has an effective targeting distance (the camera can spot it accurately) of 2 miles - that of course is way farther then you could manage to project the image in the first place, but...

	    Too many posts to read them all. This is GREAT but is a laser pointer and a camera really needed? Why not just use something like a wacom tablet and a pen to write the graffiti? No special software would be required other than something that has black background and  coloured foreground. Then you could switch colours etc etc.<br />
<br />
REPLY FROM THEO:<br />
True! but it wouldn't be laser tag then - just MS Paint and a Wacom. The idea was to give writers and the public and invisible interface where they could actually treat the building how they would treat a wall with a spray can. Some of the magic would have been lost if it was just with a wacom. Also color is actually not that great with large projections as you need as much light as you can get so regular white on black tends to be the most impressive.

	    This is really cool, but I have a few problems:<br />
<br />
I have to have my camera mounted upside down in order for everything to match up correctly.<br />
<br />
I can only get the drips to go to the left or up...<br />
<br />
I cannot get the monitor/projector set up corectly, I have to set my projector as default and still use the 'slide' button.<br />
<br />
Also, it seems to be quite slow, even though I have a fairly good video card.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is still really cool, thanks for posting the program!<br />
<br />
PS- do you know the exact hue point etc for a red laser pointer?  I kinda found it so that it works, but maybe it could be better adjusted...<br />
<br />
<br />
FROM THEO:<br />
<br />
You have to keep playing with both the yellow camera quad and the white projection quad. You can move the corners so that they line up and the drips are going in the right direction. <br />
<br />
The Slide thing is a pain - but it is possible to get it working in that mode.<br />
<br />
It being slow is probably the processor. You can always try hiding the gui elements thoigh to see if that does anything. It could be that you don't have your camera dim enough. The camera should be black really with just the laser showing up as a bright red dot. If you need to adjust your camera settings - use Amcap.<br />
<br />
Red laser is just above 0.1 from what I remember - but you really have to adjust it per laser - as the color is affected by the camera too.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

I work in a small belgian company which is specialised in high power projection.<br />
I suggest not to use the 25k as it is huge (external power supply and big weight and size),and so expensive; the 16k and 20k models are by far bright enough.<br />
My company can rent this equipment at very reasonable price, please contact dvr@adcprod.be<br />
As an example, we do the building projections for Todaysart in Den Haag.<br />
This is NOT a business opportunity for me, I am only an  employee, but I am involved in some hip-hop projects and I think this park of high-power projectors we have could be usefull.<br />
Unfortunatelly, I do not own the equipment, but feel free to e-mail Daniel VanRuysevelt if you want a really great H-P projector.<br />
Cheers,<br />
Jean-Pierre Fayt<br />

	    Hi Theo,<br />
I would like you and all the persons interested to know that my company can supply Christie projectors of 6, 9, 16 and 20 thousands ansi lumens at reasonable price.<br />
I myself am personnaly involved in hip-hop events but unfortunately I do not own the equipment, and therefore cannot offer it.<br />
Still we are a small company of 6 persons and like to do art as often as possible, like the todaysart festival in Den Haag where we did the building projections for the last three years.<br />
For prices please e-mail Daniel VanRuysevelt at dvr@adcprod.be,<br />
and for technical questions please e-mail Xavier Cauwe at xac@adcprd.be,<br />
this because I myself am \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the traveller\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and spend most of my time on gigs abroad.<br />
Here are some feedbacks \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'bout the posts i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve read:<br />
Using a Christie 25.000 lumens is to me not such a good idea as it is a huge (external power supply) and very expensive projector, and the 16 and 20 k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s are already very bright.<br />
The YAG pointers output 532 nanometers (primary green), coming from a 1064 nm (IR) source.<br />
As I see it from your videos, converting them to IR output would make it nearly impossible for the untrained operaotr to point at the building.<br />
Yet about your concern regarding the IR emission from the building itself you should not worry, it is no way near the power of a YAG.<br />
Colouring is of course the next logical step, along with spraypaint caracteristics; and most feasable too with high-power projectors; a short threshold filter of 532 nm on the camera would be the best idea as far as my knowledge goes.<br />
Best regards,<br />
Jean-Pierre <br />
<br />

	    Hi,<br />
I have a problem and I want to ask you for help. Iï¿½d like to buy a green laser, but Iï¿½m not sure which of these lasers ï¿½240mWï¿½ or ï¿½50mWï¿½ strong will be better to buy for using. Iï¿½m going to use this laser in the night, but I need need only visible laser ï¿½dotï¿½ on object, not flash beam. Please, can you tell me, if is necessary to use only laser without flash beam? Can be decetor of laser ï¿½dotï¿½  mistaked by using a stronger laser with flash beam or will be function without any problem?<br />
<br />
FROM THEO:<br />
50mW would do it! 240mW is way TOO MUCH :)

	    Hi Theo :) Really very nice Artwork! In Jully 2006 i've presented for the first time graffonic http://indicio.net/graffonic/  where i used similar processes, in a much smaller scale but with audio output. In my piece i use a red pointer instead of a green. I am improving my work in order to allow new possibilities. Just to let you know and maybe we can change some info in a near futre.<br />
Best wishes,<br />

	    Hi all :) I am also developing a new version of the http://indicio.net/graffonic piece using a IR laser pointers sponsored by an American company, they are not military exclusives. If you need more information about wavelngths and power, please let me know. About infrared light, i did this installation using ir filter in front of the camera http://3kta.net/rework<br />

	    Hey Theo,<br />
Trying to run in BootCamp, the app seems to quit out before I can figure out what's going on.<br />
<br />
Trying to run it on MacBook Pro.  Was hoping to use the built in iSight.  But seem like it wants to switch it to 320 x 240 which it can't.<br />
(i was able to figure this out when I also had a Firewire camera plugged in and the APP would hold on that screen).<br />
<br />
So am thinking I need to get the Pinnacle USB capture.  But I can only find the Pinnacle PCTV Pro which has the TV tuner.  Will this work still?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

	    Hey theo,<br />
Just one other question.<br />
When I try to run the .exe that is in the main folder.  It says that the link it wrong (it's trying to locate an alias on your website or something)<br />
<br />
So just to make sure I'm trying to run the right app for Laser Tag that it is in the BIN folder and it is simply called APP.<br />
<br />
Is that correct?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

	    Hey Theo,<br />
Just wanted to follow up on the iSight in Bootcamp.  After trying to get the Application up and running (it would quit out before I could read)....I kept doing that again until I could read it and it said I had Quicktime issues.  So I installed Quicktime and was able to get the program open and running.  The 1st try the camera had frozen on a still image.  I quit out and re-opened and it's now working.  I'm going to later tonight hook up the projector and aim the laser away and will report back how it went with the iSight and Bootcamp.  Looking forward to the fun.<br />
<br />
Since there are limitations on the iSight (no Zoom etc) I was wondering if I can use a Firewire Camera  hooked up (it shows up in my input devices in Windows Control Panel).<br />
<br />
How about a USB cam vs the USB capture card and additional camera?<br />
<br />
thanks much.<br />
I thought I was going to have to buy a PC to run this.  But Bootcamp is seeming to get me there!<br />

	    Hey Theo, this stuff is incredibly cool - I hand it to you guys making it all open source - C21st heros!  And just keep on ignoring all those commercial queries!  Would love to run this on my Macbook but NOT in bootcamp!  Who out there is a Mac guru inspired to do this?

	    I was super bummed that monitor span was needed to get this working as intended as my two laptops have ATI and Intel GMA chips. So, after reading the other posts here and a bit of googling, I found: <a>UltraMon</a>.<br />
<br />
Now it is dual-display on both. Here\'s how:<br />
<br />
1. Install UltraMon (You don\'t have to install any of the sub-options if you don\'t want.)<br />
<br />
2. Launch UltraMon from the systray and setup a new hotkey for \"Maximize window to desktop\".<br />
<br />

	    Hi<br />
<br />
The tutorial uses a 60mw green laser, will a 60mw red laser do or is there something particular about green lasers that make them work better?

	    trying to mess around a bit with the source code... when i open the codewarrior project i always get a number of error messages that some libs are missing (e.g. glfw and audiere). they are indeed not part of the .zip file and used in some components. could it be that you forgot to include some subdirs in /lib/?<br />
<br />
thanks for this great tool,<br />

	    hmm strange - there is no use of glfw or audiere in that project - I just downloaded the src from my site and tested it - it should compile fine.  try from a fresh copy first and also try "remove object code" from the build menu. Did you install the codewarrior ide with all 3 updates?

Man this is awesome!  Reading through all the comments has also been really useful.  I'm a student at MIT, and we're planning to use your code to get  this going on a large building we have here.  Its going to be a cool activity for incoming students.  I'll let you know how it goes! (or plead for help).  We have a pretty huge projector, so it should look good!

	    Hi, <br />
I´m trying to conect diferents cameras. I´m from Seville (Spain) and my videocamera is Pal. When I conect by fireware that camera the program show me that it´s working at 30-35 photogrames per second. My camera work at 25 photogrames per second. The image of the camera is very strange.<br />
On the other hand, if I connect a web-cam by usb, the program work at 25 photogrames per second but in this case show me a ERROR.<br />
I need Help... sorry for my english.<br />
Thanks

	    Hey - please paste the messages from the console window when the app runs - that should help me figure out the problem. <br />

Also it doesn't work with firewire - has to be 320 by 240 video.

	    Hey there,<br />
<br />
i just got to thank you for this great programm. I really hope you will be developing more and more versions with lots of functions, like a selectable color for the graphics. Maybe even a good way to change the direction of the drips below the writings. I still haven't figured out how to get them running down and not sideways, without turning the beamer.

	    New version is super configurable :) <br />
<br />
To get the drips to go down rotate both quads (camera and projection quad) so that they stay lined up but that the drips now drip down instead of sideways.<br />

	    So does anyone want to share a Visual Studio project? Preferably 6.0 but 2003 will also work :) I\\\'m trying to get my Wii working with it.. and/or to write  a patch for VVVV to output the same visual effects and then i could hook up just about anything. There\\\'s also an MPX patch to read in cards, which could probably be hacked to just work on any colored laser pointer as well.. hmm hmm so many ideas, so little time. *hack hack hack* ;)

	    when you download the app and ide what are the steps to follow. Like, which one first or after you extract then what. Totally lame question but I do not want to mess up because the download took forever due to my slow connection. Thanks mate.<br />
<br />
FROM THEO:<br />
Install the IDE - hit yes to all stuff except runtime for Java and 'do you want to register' - just hit close on that one.<br />
Install all the updates without restarting - after the third one it will say that the libraries need to be recompiled. hit yes. should bring up codewarrior. click on the green arrow and then wait till it is done (5-25 mins depending on your pc).  <br />
<br />
Then you should be ready to open up the laser tag codewarrior project file.

	    Theo, <br />
<br />
really excited about laser tag 2.0 finally my macbook pro will be complete!!! quick question though the camera on all your pictures and video footage that you use for tracking, is it a Watec 221s?<br />
<br />
I'm looking into buying one but I want to make sure that this camera ( http://www.watec.net/english/color/wat_221s.html ) is the right one!<br />
<br />
Where did you get yours from and how much was it?<br />
<br />
VERSION 2.0! VERSION 2.0! VERSION 2.0! Bangin!!<br />
<br />
Ali<br />
<br />
<br />
FROM THEO:<br />
It was a 221S with a super wide to zoom manual iris lens. It was about â‚¬700 - A rip off really, as you can get it for $450 in the US. <br />

	    after loading ide and updates, codewarrior opens and a Release Win32 x86 and Debug Win32 x86 opens. Which green arrow do I select. Then where do I go to open the laser app. I\'m so F\'ING lost on this. This is Fookin\' embarrassing. Thanks mate.<br />
<br />
FROM THEO:<br />
It is the Green Arrow on its own.<br />
If you turn on file extension viewing in your folders the project file for laser tag is the one that ends .mcp

<br />
- 6500 lumen projector<br />
- firewire webcam<br />
- MacBook Pro<br />
- Modded Leadlight<br />
<br />
Also, we came up with a new technique: gue a low power red laser to the green so they're perfectly aligned. Turn the red one on continuous. Now you have a pointer to see where you will write with the green beam. Eliminates the guessing!<br />
<br />
REPLY FROM THEO: Dope!!!! Seriously nice shit man! good idea with the red Laser - thats what snipers use them for : )<br />

	    Hi.I've almost made it but one step left.I connect the projector to my laptop and set the display mode to horizontal span as you say.But when I run the app, my projector display nothing.The video card of my laptop is Nvidia Geforce Go 7400. So I have to make the projector projects exactly what the desktop displays and use the "slide" command to do the demo(black background &amp; white brush)<br />
<br />
REPLY FROM THEO: <br />
If you can see you extended desktop on the projector then the app should work. Make sure your combined res is set to 2048 by 768

	    I\'ve seen in a couple places the acronym \"L.A.S.E.R.\" around this site and the GRL site. We all know that \"laser\" really is an acronym for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.\"  but no one ever uses periods like I\'ve seen around here.  Do you guys use \'laser\' to stand for something else?<br />

	    Hey, since the maximum power lazer we can buy is 5mW, can this still work? What about at a much closer range?  Please contact me Abraxas_2_0_0_5@yahoo.com

	    Luckily, I have a 20mw green laser pointer lying around, a projector (mounted indoors, though), and a stream-able camera. It worked! Amazingly, some really cool open source software finally works on my system. Now, if only it had a resizable separate window for the projection...

	    Hey Theo! Awesome project you guys are developing!!<br />
<br />
Im not quite sure how to get it to work though.. I followed the instructions above but no luck.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the app and amcap. Im using just my webcam as i saw other people were getting results with them. When opening amcap y gets the video feed from the webcam just fine. But when i run your app it does its thing in DOS and then opens fine but the feed that its getting is from a video of a building (which came in the downloaded zip file. How can i switch from that video to the "live" feed from the webcam? <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated! I read ALL the comments took me over an hour but i got some real good tips out of many people!<br />
<br />

	    Keep up the good work Theo!  Anxiously awaiting version 2!<br />
<br />
For anyone out there who wants to project in different colors, there\'s a manual workaround.  A very handy tool to have for lots of projects is a theatrical lighting gel swatchbook, which is a small book of anywhere from dozens to hundreds of samples of lighting gels.  They are used in the film / video / theater industries to plan and test lighting.  You can get them pretty cheap(for example: http://www.adorama.com/ROSB.html?searchinfo=swatch&amp;item_no=1)<br />
<br />
Then just fan open the swatch book and place the desired color filter in front of your projector lens.  I\'ve had good luck with this technique. The individual filters may not be large enough to cover the lens if you have a giant projector, but they work fine on my unit.<br />
<br />
p.s. - Thanks a lot to Jonah for the tip mentioned above about using UltraMon to span the desktop!

	    Oh, and also, I've noticed that the Line Resolution setting appears to have no effect.  Whether it's set at 25 or 150, the line looks the same.  Any ideas?

	    thank you "eugi" that was pretty obvious...  my bad! lol<br />
<br />
well so i got everything to work just fine with the projector and i am using a red laser pointer for the moment. But i have a few questions...<br />
<br />
The response from the moment i move the laser to when the projector projects light is kind of slow. Do you think this can be due to the laptop im using? Its a p4 3.0 win xp, 1gb ram, nvidia 64mb video card.<br />
<br />
The other issue is.. the movement is just fine but for some reason the projector is projecting light (the stroke) something like 30-50 cms (1 foot) away from the laser.. so it is not right where im pointing with the laser. Any ideas why? is there a setting i have to tweak to have the projection right on the laser? (so it is more precise)<br />
<br />
One last thing, the drips are going in the wring direction (i had to flip the projector to get the stroke in the right direction, any idea how to fix the drips? (rotate them in some way).<br />
<br />
By the way, i dont know if this helps but im using a webcam as part of my setup.<br />
<br />
Will i have a better trak if i have a more powerful laser? or a better camera? my current laser is 0.95 mw strong and is color red.<br />
<br />
thank you all!<br />
<br />

The only problem is... I can\'t get anything to recompile.  I\'m using Dev C++.  I\'m not sure if I have openFrameworks set up right, or which .cpp or .h I should compile first, blah blah.  As I said, I\'m not the great at the knowing the fudamentals of programming. sorry, and thanks for any help

	    hey mate, When choosing a projector do you have to stick does throw distance really matter. Because the alternate projector you have suggested, the BenQ PB8253, has a relativly small throw distance compared to the Panasonic projector you use. DOes this mean you can not project on as large of a surface. Also does this effect how close you have to be to the wall??<br />
Thanks for your help

If I released a beta then I would have a gazillion help / feature requests which would slow me down even more. The post for version 2 was just to show that it is being worked on. Write the code yourself if you think I am 'slackin'! :)

	    Hey guys any idea why the projection is not right ontop of the laser? Everything's working great but for some reason the projection is a foot or so away from the laser. For example,  if i draw a line from top to bottom with the laser, the projector will draw that exact same line from top to bottom but a foot or so to the right of the laser... there is probably a quick fix for this.. let me know thanks!!<br />

	    Just adjust the camera quad so either it matches the projected quad (use the L key) or just keep adjusting the camera quad till the laser and projected paint line up.

	    i cant see what im doing wrong... When i hit L i get the \"edge\" projection. So that is working fine but when i change the shape of the yellow \"quad\" (videoIn: Select Sub Region) nothing changes in the projection.. it should, right? what am i doing wrong?<br />
<br />
thanks for you help guys! <br />

Hey Alex, Nothing will change in the projection until you draw with the laser. What I usually do is:<br />
<br />
get the edges of the projected quad to the edges of my surface so I am happy with the shape. <br />
<br />
Then shine the laser at each corner of the projected quad and look in the camera video and drag the nearest corner of the yellow quad to that position. <br />
<br />
This way you know that the yellow quad is exactly lining up with the projected quad. <br />
<br />
I don't know if that helps.<br />
<br />
Also if you are doing it really close up and with a wideangle lens the laser and the paint will never line up perfectly as there is a circular lens distortion which is hard to take into account.

	    Hey, I've had limited experience with c++ and openFrameworks, but I thought I would try giving this shot. I've been able to successfully compile the openFrameworks examples going through the tutorial on their site for visual c++, but I can't seem to get this to compile. Does anyone have any tips for compiling? I'm using the "new projector from existing code" feature of Microsoft VC++ Express edition.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

	    err, \"new project\" from existing code I mean. <br />
<br />
I just read what I wrote and realized it was very vague, so I\'ll go into more detail.<br />
<br />
It seems like the compiler is having trouble finding include files even though they are in my folder structure. I\'m getting a lot of  can not find file errors, I think the compiler for some reason doesn\'t know where to look for the files. <br />
<br />
Here is an example error: 1&gt;c:\\openframeworks\\v0.02\\app\\lazer_test_013_day1\\src\\classes\\analysis\\axisfinder.h(3) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: \'ofMain.h\': No such file or directory<br />
<br />
So it can\'t find a file which is clearly there.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the past I\'ve mostly compiled stuff that already has an .sln file, not just the code. I\'ve used what little knowledge I have about project references and includes but I still can\'t figure it out.<br />
<br />
I realize this is probably a beginner c++ issue and definitely not a lasertag issue, but if anyone can help or point to a good article about project dependencies or something I would definitely appreciate it.<br />
<br />
REPLY FROM THEO:<br />
Hey! I am glad you are getting into openFrameworks. We found the easiest way to make new projects is to just duplicate one of the example projects and rename the folder so ofGraphicsExample becomes ofMyTestExample or something. Please also sign up to the openFrameworks forum as there will be much more thorough support there! <br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

	    I'm using the same Panasonic PT-D5600U projector they are using. The stock 5600 lens is a 1.30:1. Your Barco's will need about 10 amps AC, have some serious power available. In my opinion your Barco's should work fine. Only way to find out is to get out and run some tests. <br />
<br />
Pick up a cheap VGA splitter box (eBay) to use both of them.<br />
Theo might have other info for you, but I thought I would chime in since he hasn't been on here in a week, busy dude I would imagine.<br />

	    Sman - <br />
<br />
Instead of running LASERAPP.exe - Try this to access the app.exe directly.<br />
<br />
From the main download files:<br />
LaserTag013SrcAndApp / app / LAZER_TEST_013_DAY1 / bin / app.exe<br />
<br />
Run the \"app.exe\" and it should load up for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I did was create an app.exe shortcut on my desktop to make it easier to run while out in the field.<br />

	    hi! i have downloaded the 100mb file, and have tried to run the application, but it said it couldn\'t find \"app.exe\", which i found in one of the other folders, so i pointed it to that, and a black window came up, but then an error came up and said \"cannot find file named \"zlib.dll\"\"<br />
what is does this mean, and how do you fix it?<br />

	    well now i have somehow fixed that problem, but now there is another one? the image apears to be upside down, because when i move my laser side to side, it goes up and down on the projector, and when i move it up and down, it goes side to side?? oh and also, the drips run UP the screen instead of down?? how could i fix this?<br />

	    Hi Theo!<br />
<br />
Currently assembling all of the materials and have a few questions:<br />
1. Will any USB 2.0 Video Capture product work? Can you provide a link to the actual Pinnacle PCTV USB Video Capture Card you used?  Can't seem to find it on Amazon.com<br />
<br />
2. Is a 15.4" Macbook Pro Core Duo 2.0 with 256 MB X1600 video card sufficiently powerful for this project?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help on this.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
Not a programmer or a computer scientist here so I don't really know about re-compiling the program for the Mac platform.  Was thinking of dual booting to Windows XP

	    peace, fellow discordians! power to the pixelheads! :) seriously, fantastic werk and please, never stop... couple tech ??s- we are planning a high-profile championing of this idea (GRL WILL get due shouts! :) but need to know your thoughts on using a high-contrast ratio LCD (specifically, an Eiki LC-X71 - got s PLENTY of lumens (5500) and we can get one of several lenses (1.3-4.2), but not sure if you have any experience with LCD vs DLP - saw the previous threads about the Pan's liquid-cooled and ok-to-90&#730; advantages, but thoughts on LCD vs DLP tech? experience? Also, any thoughts on using a B&amp;W cammy vs color? ie, Watec 525EX - seems to have manual controls, but waiting to get full specs - thoughts? experience?? will appreciate the feedback, cause we're hoping to do this SOON - 4 major US cities on the SAME NIGHT! yeeeah, baby! thanx, PTFO...<br />

	    Hey,<br />
<br />
This is great, I got everything to work EXCEPT that when I write sometihng, it doesnt get recorded on the screen.  What i mean is, It tracks the laser perfectly, does everything its supposed to do, but then no writting, so its a very nice white dot going all over the screen but nothing getting written to it, what could I be doing wrong? any ideas anyone?

	    I had that problem and found it was just a matter of playing with the threshold values of hue etc and perhaps toying with the camera settings too. Rest assured nothing is actually wrong.

	    Throwies were cool. This might just be better. Worked first time with very little tweaking. Bought a 10mv laser off ebay - easily powerful enough for most applications (with added beenfit of not burning skin/blinding etc), plugged in a webcam  and projector and had a play. Fantastic! To make drips run down the screen just change line 47 of testApp.h from cx++; to cy--; and recompile.<br />
<br />
Rest assured we will put this to excellent use! Thanks again.<br />

	    We are stoked on using this software but are running into a bit of difficulty.<br />
We are using macbook g4,canon xl1s camera, canon lv7250 projector, and lastly a 5mw green laser. <br />
Where we are running into problems is camera detection. We have the camera running through firewire and when we hit c to calibrate it it doesn\\\'t work. Nor is it being detected. Is there a work around you are familiar with? We are hoping to get the \\\"word\\\" out and the generator &amp; sound-system are ready to go. Please help !!!! Thanks so much for this wonderful app !!!!!

	    Hi Theo Genius !<br />
I am wondering if your fantastic program can support more than one projector. We are in the process to setup a huge projected surface and we would like to use 2 or more projectors which can cover partly the area projected. Like 3 projectors in parallel horizontally....can we do it ? Any suggestion ? do we have to change the code ? easy ? thanks in advance !!<br />

	    We're going to build this and I'm psyched! Quick question, we have a Canopus aDVC110, will that work in place of a Pinnacle PCTV USB capture card?  Does anyone have a link to a good capture card?  Thanks!

	    for this to work you need a projector with a high (5000_ lumen output. and the one used in this project costs $4000 - $9000.

	    Nice work Theo...fantastic. I have a sony 1200 lumens projector, a red laser 5mw and a cheap cam (0,5 mpixel). I made it work, but the lines they are slow and  clumsily drawn.i mean that i'm moving the laser point and the line appear after a second(i can't draw free forms). Is the camera doing that or something else?. I forgot to tell that my laptop specification is: 64mb video card onboard, 1,70 cetrino mobile technology, 512ram, winxp and sp2.<br />
<br />
I thank in advance...Ôhe greek.

	    Firstly you might want to try the new software (check the latest post on my blog) and also in it - try it with the Advanced Quad disabled - this should help a lot. you also might need a brighter laser.

	    All tests are with the new software and the andvaned Quad disable... and the problem  it remains. The first think i thought is the camera, because its a messenger cam(low quality), so you  move your hand and you see the moved hand after a "second"!!!, if you know what i mean. Tell me your opinion about my thought, also is all specification of my staff ok for this project? And one last question: Because i dont have a brighter laser now.. if i test the currentlaser getting closer to the wall?<br />

Thanks again... the greek

	    I use the version 2 at home as the 1st doesn't seem to go onto the 2nd screen (projector). i use it at home in my room and have to severly change the camera steeings. My dad likes it very much. as it only inside, i don't think i need a bright projector just yet, though. i hope to use the software on close buildings around my area, with the owner's permission, of course.<br />
<br />
I think that the LaserTag2 is SOOOO good.<br />

	    If you want to get a cheap laser that will do the job, check out dealextreme.com. Their 'true 30mw' green laser will do the trick. Referring people to wicked lasers should be a crime..lol. Waaaay overpriced, underspeced, bad customer service. Check out my listed website for more places to get lasers and laser related items. Id love to see someone use the source to this project and create the same thing with a laser projector. =D

	    We need to experiment with Vikuiti from 3M<br />
<br />
It is a bad-ass projection film that can be die-cut. You project on the back of it. I have seen it at lots of malls and retailers.<br />
<br />
It is kind of pricey though. a 4x8 sheet is like 3k. I have been slowly oredering samples from 3M using my work address.<br />
<br />
you can form it to substrates too.<br />
<br />
w00t!<br />

	    I am a huge admirer of this work! It is truly breathtaking…<br />
<br />
Alys Beach, Florida is hosting a \"Digital Arts\" festival on August 30th, and we looking for artists to participate. This work with the laser tag really inspired us to plan this event.<br />
<br />
Some photos of our growing resort town can be seen at www.pbase.com/abfl/digital_graffiti. The concept is for digital artists like ya'll to come to the town and use our town as a canvas! As you can see, the architecture is influenced by the homes of Bermuda and Antigua Guatemala and is characterized by its clean white stucco facades. <br />
<br />
Visitors will be invited to meander through the community’s many courtyards and pedestrian walkways and experience a wide range of digital arts ‘experiences.’ Again, this work is fantastic and we would be thrilled to work with some of you digital artists.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible!<br />
<br />
If interested, please email events@alysbeach.com<br />
<br />
Ps…we ordered our laser today to try the laser tag program. I can’t wait to try it!<br />

	    We did a similar thing in a drama studio with a ceiling about 150ft high and mounted the projector camera rig facing down then got people wearing black clothes and helmets with green LED\'s on them to walk around, amazing effect, the trails follow them around, we also put another video camera up there to record what it saw but having problems uploading to youtube - will post again with link when I can.

	    Hy Theo,<br />
<br />
We're from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. I'm starting to do some laserTAG improvments. I'm translating the software to portuguese, add new brushes, change some codes, to optmize and some interface add. But i'm not a programmer, i'm new to that, but trying hard to learn. I wanna know if there is any way to add midi interface to control what i want to, for examle a knob to the brush size. If its possible, what I have to do? what kind of strings, etc, should i've looking for... And another thing. It is possible to add 2 cams at the same time, for diferent things. Because i want to try using reacTIVision system to control. How heavy to the system this could be? Its possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

	    Ohh cool! Nice!<br />
Yeah we desperately need a better interface for changing settings without having a photoshop style interface on the side of the projection (that would ruin it). A wireless gamepad is also an option.<br />
<br />
For midi / camera stuff send me an email we can chat further.  theo@(this site)  <br />

<br />
Can you say anythingabout a distance neede to project.<br />
And then can we do it with a 5k beam?

	    wow - that is a nightmare to project onto.<br />
<br />
1 - it is lit up which will wash out the projection and make tracking very hard<br />
<br />
2 - too many windows - the laser can't be tracked over the windows and all the lights in the windows would need to be turned off.<br />
<br />
3- the shape would make it difficult unless you just did a small area.<br />
<br />
For projection as a rule you need 1.3-1.5 times the distance from the surface, as the width you want the projected image to appear.<br />
<br />

Maybee if he can makes sure the lights on the top floors are turn off?<br />
But I guess we need to take one angle of the building because it is slightly V shaped.<br />

But you think we can still pull it off with a 5K projector?<br />

	    Thanks for the software!  Last night we got it working and projected onto the "Daughters of the Confederacy" building here in Charleston, SC.  Our weak link right now is our old Sony Camcorder, going to upgrade cameras and steup up to 75 mW laser for future projects.<br />
<br />
Can you recommend specific color settings for the software to read the laser, or does it vary greatly based on the camera?  We just played with the settings til it worked, but could negver get it perfect.

	    Trying to set this up for the first time using a Mac Book Pro and connected to a panasonic AG-DVX 100b cam corder via firewire.  I pull up the software but none of the shortcuts you mention like "c" for camera settings also the overall interface looks completely different than the one described in your instructions.  What am i doing wrong or not doing at all?!?!?!?! Thanks for your feedback in advance!

	    if i owned a laser already that has an output power of around 250mw, will this still work or will it be so strong that it might pick up the beam and the dot?

Save your money, and buy your lasers only from reputable dealers.

	    Just tried this in linux with wine, and it runs, but it really hates my cam, and if it accesses it then it crashes (I will blame wine on this one).<br />
<br />
I am however suggesting that others who have a cam that this likes they may be able to use it this way.<br />
<br />
For reference, if it cannot access /dev/video it will display the control pane just like it would in windows.  I might look at a backtrace and see why it breaks when accessing the camera because that may be a bug in this software which could be repaired.  I did however get the same printed errors in windows (in vmware) so that leads me to believe that wine is returning something different and causing the breakage.

	    Hey Everyone:<br />
<br />
Wouldn't this project be easier with a drawing-screen type setup? Wacom makes a tablet that acts also as a display. If you were to recode the part of the application that looks for the laser point you'd be able to eliminate the laser (making it more legal in some places and safer everywhere). Of course, that does take the fun out of having an excuse for a really powerful laser. <br />
<br />
In any case, the tablet would allow you to draw, quite literally, on the image of the building or target surface, without having to develop gigantor motor skills related to drawing that well that large. You'd have the image right there in the display. <br />
<br />
The wacom tablet can be found at their site and, for those of us (like me) who are financially impaired, they do have different sizes. <br />
<br />
http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/index.cfm<br />
<br />
Another option might be the Axiotron ModBook. Slightly pricey but it would reduce the number of items to keep track-of and power. The other advantage of having this option is that the camera is already part of the computer. You can change what it looks at by creating a mirrored device that will do that for you, or you can buy one. If you set this up just in front of the projector people could see, real time, what they're doing on the building as they do it. Just like the laser only smaller. It would integrate a number of images on the display as it is.<br />
<br />
I have included a link for one you can build:<br />
<br />
http://www.instructables.com/id/Per-i-Sight%3a-MacBook-iSight-Periscope/<br />
<br />
Or you can buy the manufactured one:<br />
<br />
http://www.mungaimirrors.co.uk/huckleberry/ilisp.php<br />
<br />
I am not entirely sure what or how I'm going to manifest my own "piss off" to the corporate greedmonsters but I certainly feel something percolating. Your work has most assuredly had a profound influence on me and how near I am to ~doing~ something. It has been hard to figure out ~what~ to do in the face of all the evil and lies of powerlessness and isolation. Financial issues also complicate the process.<br />
<br />
Finding other people to help and or participate seems to be a tad of a challenge and I'm not sure how to manage that. It doesn't help that I'm already paranoid by nature. With everyone else equally paranoid (and with a rather trigger happy police force where I'm at) collaboration for anything, much less questionable artistic expression, has proven to be dangerous for a few.<br />
<br />
Thank you for BEING!<br />
<br />
Most sincerely,<br />
<br />
Paul

	    Adjust the camera settings so the image is as dark as possible. <br />
<br />
Turn off auto gain / auto shutter / auto exposure. <br />
Set the shutter speed to be fast which gives you a higher capture rate and also and darker image. The image should be as dark as possible with the laser still being a clear light dot.  <br />
<br />
Then once you have that you should play with the tracking settings (mainly saturation thresh and brightness thresh ) till you get the point being tracked well.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

	    Glad you are frustrated - you work for a marketing company. So why would I want to help you set it up when you are most likely trying to use it for some tacky marketing events. <br />
<br />
Forgive me if I am wrong in this case - but Laser Tag is for non-commercial usage and non-promotional / non-marketing only. <br />
<br />
What you ask for has already been provided anyway - a step by step guide to setting up Laser Tag - many other people have managed to run it with the instructions provided - you shouldn't need more than that. <br />

 In the spirit of "marketing" let me get down with you. my name "big tex marketing" is just that. I am a brand, I want this shit for myself, you can't pay me enough to "sell" it. i don't do tacky shit. I understand your apprehension and not here to argue my point, i respect what GRL is doing and wanted it. <br />
<br />
keep up the good work

	    Thanks for all the work you put into this Theo.  Finally got around to gathering all the components and can't wait to start throwing some laser art around campus.  Not sure how often you check this page, but with how many people just ask for help I figured it would be nice to just drop a thanks.

	    I'm interested in acquiring this setup. What brand of laser pointer would you recommend? I realize that one that is less than 60 mW would work, but since 60 mW lasers can be acquired for only $200, I think it is cost effective to go this way. Is there one in particular that will last a long time and be reliable?<br />
<br />
Also, since projectors are very expensive, I ended up dumpster diving and getting one from Kodak. I'm not sure how bright it is, but what would you say the minimal brightness for a projector would be for this? I aim to use this outdoors from some distance, although perhaps not as far as you were doing it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time!

	    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am currently organising a arts and new media festival in England and we are hoping to use your cool laser tagging for an exhibit. Will the software work on mac or is it best to use  a pc laptop? <br />

Many Thanks, <br />

	    A commercial product called Afterglow (www.afterglow.biz)was just released.  The product is expensive but it allows a presenter to use the product with PowerPoint or any program.  Does Laser Tag work with other programs?  Also, does anyone know of any inexpensive solutions to do the same thing with a laser pointer for business use?

	    I wrote a week ago, but my comentary got erased.  the software is runnig but nothing happens.  We have a benq projector (1500 lummens) a HP laptop, a 1.3 mp web cam and a radio shack with and output power less than 5 mW.  It's this enought or I need other equipment?  I downloaded the laser tag 2002 pc app xp.<br />
The thing is that i draw with the laser but nothing happens on the wall.<br />
Do you have instructions in spanish?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

	    First off, this rocks. Urban art, lasers, interactive projections, opensource. Kudos to  Theo and Zachary.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get a rig up for my wedding in a couple months, almost got a basic system up (HP laptop, Dell projector, cheap webcam, cheap 30mW laser from $someplace on the net), but the laser's crapped out (duff mechanics, I think). Any recommendations for a *reliable* 15-30mW laser for this (on a tight time and $ budget, so can't afford to Be Wrong).<br />
<br />
(Name witheld, in case my g/f sees this..)<br />

	    Does anyone know the .plist(mac preference) file this creates on a mac.  I made some changes to the Openframeworks preferences, and now it just opens and quits real quick.

	    hi Theo,<br />
<br />
have an interesting problem for you. I've been using LaserTag2002 on my Macbook Pro just fine until tonight, when I was using another OpenFrameworks based program called Quase-Cinema. Accidentally hit "reset to defaults" and quit the app, which I suppose saved some kind of awful prefs in OF that now make it so I can't even open LaserTag or Quase Cinema.<br />
<br />
Tried reinstalling, to no avail. Error I get in console has to do with no valid package in file /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax/Contents/MacOS/Adobe Unit Types.<br />
<br />
Any idea if you can help a brother out? Thanks!<br />
<br />

	    Awesome work Theo &amp; your crew! Love it. Thank you!<br />
<br />
So finally got a good laser pointer and got the software working well with my computer and camera. <br />
OK, now I'm keen to set it up for graf artist friends to let loose on some big spaces around AK... <br />
<br />
The thing I need to ask/check with you about is the bit about not using it for commercial purposes. How does that work if it's set up at like outside a club night and the night has some sponsors like Red Bull or some drinks brands? Is that OK? <br />
I saw that they were gonna use it at the Big Day Out here in Auckland and all over Oz. Is that OK with you? I'm asking because that's a really big heavy sponsored event.<br />
<br />
 Like is it sweet as long as people don't use it to advertise specific products up there, just stick to tags, graf and artwork? <br />
<br />
Would be good to clear on this as I don't want to abuse your guys trust that you've shown by putting it out there as open source. <br />
<br />
Nuff respect! <br />
<br />

	    I got this working with the on board camera on my laptop but I want to get some distance on it. <br />
<br />
I have a 3600 lumen projector, a 60mW laser, a dv camera and an ATI capture card.<br />
<br />
in AMCap when I open it up it shows static but when i click to Options/Crossbar Video Input/Video Composite, the video shows fine.<br />
<br />
When I open the Laser Grafitte software it just shows static like its defaulting to the digital tuner on the capture card.<br />
<br />
is there a way to manually set the crossbar in the laser grafitti software?

	    Totally got this working. Since the capture card was defaulting to the digital tuner, I ran the composite video through a VCR. This allowed me to use a coaxial cable which could be put into the digital tuner. <br />
<br />
Works beautifully. Thanks so much for this. You guys are geniuses.

	    So I had the L.A.S.E.R. tag running great on my MacBook Pro but them on saturday night my laptop did an auto software update and now I have problems. The programs starts fine and runs the demo video but when I change the use camera setting from "0" to "1" and program crashes when i restart it. It won't even open. Also pressing "c" does not bring up the camera setting anymore. The only way I can get it to start again is if i go into the setting.xml file and manually change the use camera setting back to "0." Anyone have any possible fixes? I really need help. Had some big plans for this setup in the coming months. I really hope I can get this fixed. Please Help!!!<br />

	    Escape flocks ofchristian louboutin shoes, and get a bit of a workout hiking into the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone, where wide stretches of river and prolific hatches support a healthy cutthroat and rainbow population. The best louboutin wedding shoes are pretty remote, so plan on making a multi-day trip. Camping in the Christian Louboutin Short Boots is the best way to get acquainted with its incredible variety of flora and fauna, steaming geysers and bubbling thermal mud pots, spectacular christian louboutin tall boots and river canyons, and extraordinary vistas. Yellowstone has front-country camping facilities at a dozen sites scattered around the park. And backcountry permits are available at most christian louboutin discount and visitor centers.

The thing I need to ask/check with you about is the bit about not using it for commercial purposes. How does that work if it's set up at like outside a club night and the night has some sponsors like Red Bull or some drinks brands? Is that OK?<br />
I saw that they were gonna use it at the Big Day Out here in Auckland and all over Oz. Is that OK with you? I'm asking because that's a really big heavy sponsored event.<br />

Wearing jewelry is also a change of seasons matching problem. Early spring, wear jade, emerald and malachite and other jewelry, be very refreshing and vibrant spirit. Flowers bloom in the season, wearing ruby, turquoise and other jewelry, the color will be even more beautiful and moving. Sapphire, aquamarine, lapis lazuli and amethyst jewelry, etc., will be great in the summer style. Topaz, opal, amber, agate and other jewelry, can bring the feeling of coming autumn.

	    How to prolong	inspiron 1525 batteryinspiron 1525 battery's life?Well,the 	dv6000 battery	is lithium-ion battery.It works on ion movement between the positive and negative electrodes.The easiest way to give your t61 battery an early death is to damage it.And the two most common causes of damage inspiron 6400 battery	are from overheating and using an AC adapter with the wrong voltage.Use a cooling pad when using	hp g60 battery.Clean your desk,dust will get into the vents and clog the cooling fan making	hp dv7 battery	have worse life.Consider taking your	pa3399u battery out when using your laptop plugged into AC power.You do not need to discharge g4 powerbook battery fully and recharge constantly.For a new dell d800 battery	,you're not supposed to store it empty.And 	t60 battery left out of the machine will lose charge over time. You're not supposed to leave the	dell d620 battery	in the machine and run on AC all the time. Doing so will kill the life expectancy.You're not supposed to charge cycle the dell d630 battery frequently, as the long-term life expectancy is measured in charge cycles.<br />
You're not supposed to deep discharge the nv52 battery.You're not supposed to use the dell inspiron 6000 battery		before it has finished charging.Well,my question is two-fold,Which of these are true?how to maximizing the long-term life of a pa3534u	battery.I'm fairly sure that (c) is true, as I have been a lot more careful about charge-cycling than I was with my previous	m1210 battery.This dv2000 battery	is still at about 90% of the original capacity after a year.<br />
I usually run my laptop with the inspiron 1545 battery.My advice is to avoid using the	inspiron 1501 battery for just a few minutes.If you use the	sony bps13 battery,drain the	a1185 battery, then recharge once it gets down below 5-7%.Otherwise, keep it on AC power, with or without the inspiron 1520 battery	inside. This has worked well for me.If u this this is good advice for extending your	hpdv4 battery	life,just do it like I said.Then u can own long life	laptops batteries.

	    Don't have cash to buy a house? You not have to worry, just because it's achievable to take the home loans to work out such kind of problems. Hence get a term loan to buy all you require.

	    Has a solution been found for the MAC OS Snow Leopard bug?  I had Laser Tag running for a about a minute and then it crashed. <br />
Now when I try to open it, it will try to launch my isight camera (the little light beside the cam turns green-for about a second or two) then it shuts the program down.   I go into the settings.xml file reset the use camera value to  0 and I can get the program running but no camera.   Any help would be great - thanks mark<br />

	    Don't have cash to buy some real estate? Don't worry, just because it is real to receive the personal loans to work out all the problems. Thus take a credit loan to buy everything you require.

	    I propose not to hold off until you get enough amount of money to buy different goods! You should just take the loan or just auto loan and feel comfortable

	    Many families have now shifted their focus to purchasing their kids computers instead of wasteful video games as they spend more time in the home and less on out door activities.  The idea of buying refurbished or used computers was at one time considered a bad idea but in today’s market it is excellent money saving option.  Kids in today’s world can put a computer to good use as they are required in many schools.<br />

Along with all the best deals on laptops, don’t forget to look for all those bonuses and perks that merchants like to throw in this time of year. Things like free accessories, coupons off other products and even free or expedited shipping from time to time! Every merchant has a different deal so take the time to browse through the list before deciding on which Christmas laptop sales to choose! Just sit back with a nice hot cup of coffee, and start clicking away. Your new laptop is out there. We should know, after all, we found the deal for you! <br />

	    I'm having a problem where the camera is picking up the actual paintbrush strokes as if it were the laser pointer. So, the brush will start freaking out, stop following the laser pointer and painting on its own. The only fix we've figured out so far is using the darkest colored brush (blue), so it doesn't get picked up. It also only works when we don't designate a color to track (rather, we set it to just track based on brightness). Do you think this is a problem w/ the quality of our camera? Or is it the laser pen? Any insight would be much appreciated.

	    I enlisted the help of some fellow geeks after I'd spent more than 80 hours customizing campaigns on all there of the major providers; Google UGG Halendi Sandals burberry bags,Louis Vuitton Monogram Multicolore Ballerina in Blue chanel bags, Bing and Yahoo.?? Now; Yahoo and Bing are merging so that's good news because you'll be able to get your rejections in just one place.? As you can imagine Google holds the market.? Many people who still have hotmail end up getting Bing chosen for them automatically while some savvy people have figured out how to change their default search engine.My basic complaint with Google is this.? The entire campaign can "look like" everything is green or approved but in actuality your PPC ads are not running.?? The keyword research tool is fabulous but it really needs to tell you what keywords are known as unusable.? This would save a lot of time.Bottom line is that I have tried and abandoned PPC on Google Ugg Ashur Boots 5760 Chestnut For Sale chanel handbags,Chanel Women Sneaker burberry scarf, Bing Chanel 6280-black with letters louis vuitton outlet,Chanel Bags uggs clearance, Yahoo and Miva.? If anyone has another with a track record of providing PPC please respond to this article and share your results good or bad.?? Until then I'm afraid those of us that despise porn pop-up pages and spam email are in for nothing but more porn pop-ups and spam email.

One of the options the default blogger comments lack is the option to reply to an individual comment.In fact it was one of the reasons i changed from blogger comments to Disqus comments.I have however come across a cool blogger hack that will enable comment replies for blogger.<br />

	    Make it Easy to Comment I leave a lot of comments on a lot of blogs each week – but there is one situation where I rarely leave a comment – even if the post deserves it – blogs that require me to login before making a comment. Maybe I’m lazy (actually there’s no maybe about it) or maybe there’s something inside me that worries about giving out my personal details..<br />

	    GSCopy Pro v6.0 (RoboCopy Alternative) with Open File Agent<br />
GSCopyPro is a single command-line tool (CLI) that can copy, replicate and move files from one folder to another. This folder can be on the same machine/ server or another server elsewhere. What makes GSCopyPro stand out from other competitors is the fact it works on 32-bit as well as 64-bit systems and has no restrictions. It can easily be scheduled to run as a scheduled task and fully automated. GSCopyPro also comes with an open file agent which can copy files that are locked/ opened by other processes. This feature is supported in all windows versions from widows XP/ 2003 and later.<br />

	    GSCopy Pro v6.0 (RoboCopy Alternative) with Open File Agent<br />
GSCopyPro is a single command-line tool (CLI) that can copy, replicate and move files from one folder to another. This folder can be on the same machine/ server or another server elsewhere. What makes GSCopyPro stand out from other competitors is the fact it works on 32-bit as well as 64-bit systems and has no restrictions. It can easily be scheduled to run as a scheduled task and fully automated. GSCopyPro also comes with an open file agent which can copy files that are locked/ opened by other processes. This feature is supported in all windows versions from widows XP/ 2003 and later.<br />
